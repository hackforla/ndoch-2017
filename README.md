This repo is for planning Hack For LA's 2017 National Day of Civic Hacking event.

## Datathon/Storython

Goal for participants: *Tell a story about Los Angeles using data.*

"Fall into Data"? :)

* 9/23/17 - Kickoff Event introduces people to civic data sources, storytelling, and analyzing data.
* Weekly Civic Hack Nights - participants can have a space to work, bounce around ideas, and get technical help.
* TBD Oct./Nov. Date - SCDC Public Launch Event - participants present their story pitches, and stories get published.

The event will be structured around a theme with specific questions posed to attendees to answer or think about.  We'll need to gather experts and compile references/guides about the data.  CCF would like to introduce the idea of being part of a larger community around civic data.  The stories can involve data visualizations.

Planning will involve weekly 30-minute calls up until the event.  Organizers will be split up to focus on production and programming.

## 9/23/17 Kickoff Event
